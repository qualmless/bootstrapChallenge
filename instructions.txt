Let's kick off the morning with a coding challenge.  This is ungraded and a chance for self-assessment in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and GitHub.  Come back at 9am to review the solution and break in to groups for the last project of this class.

** CODING CHALLENGE: BOOTSTRAP GRID **

Create a new project in VS Code and sync it with GitHub.com.  Include an HTML file that does the following:

Includes Bootstrap’s CSS file in the <head>
Has a bootstrap grid with 3 rows. The first has 3 columns, the second has 2 columns, and the 3rd row has 1 column. This is all when the screen width is large or bigger
That same grid, when on a screen that is size Small or larger, shouldn’t have more than 2 columns per row.
Color the backgrounds of these divs with different colors so that each column can be seen.
(Optional, if time permits)  add an image to one of the columns and make it responsive. Add a Jumbotron above your 3 rows. Change the columns so that at screen width medium or larger, each column spans all 12 of the grid units.

Hint: to make a column behave one way when the screen is XL, you just give the div a class of col-xl-4 where the number (4 in this example) is a number of grid units out of 12 that the column should span.  To make that same column behave differently on a small screen, you could ALSO give it the class of col-sm-6, and now that same column on a small screen will span 6 of the 12 grid units. An example of the syntax is as follows:

<div class”col-xl-5 col-sm-7”>I am the content</div>

Message me your GitHub pages URL before 9am - whether you're done or not!
